# Odin Calculator

This is the final project for The Odin Project's [Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator), demonstrating the combined use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Inputs can be received either through keyboard or clicking on the on-screen buttons. Floating point decimal numbers are supported, while negative numbers are partially supported (only the first operand can be negative). Press C for backspace, and AC to fully clear all inputs.
